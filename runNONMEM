How run NONMEM from an R script

This function allow to lunch a NONMEM run directly from the R shell. 
The function will open a shell window on which it is possibe to see the output of the run. 
If not all the output from NONMEM it is required and a large number of simulations need to be performed (e.g. in a CTS exercise) 
it is possible to provide a list of file names or folders to be deleted. 
It is also possible to ask the function to change the seed within the NONMEM control file; 
this option is particularly useful if the function is included within an iterative loop. 
The argument i of the function will be added to the current seed in order to change it at each call of the function, 
so e.g. within a for loop it is possible to use the index of the loop to assure a different seed at each call.


Example of R code to run NONMEM

```

Run the command nmf6 followed by the string nonmemModel

In this way, it is not possible to change the seed within the modelfile

Since the modelfile is provided together with the output file

runNonmem(nonmemModel = "modelSim.mod table", 
          changeSeed = FALSE, 
           i = 1, 
           deleteFiles = TRUE, 
           fileToDelete = c("PRDERR","nonmem.exe","LINK", "ifort.txt","fsubs.obj","fsubs.for", 
                            "FSUBS","FSTREAM","FREPORT", "FDATA","FCON","table"),
           commandToExecute = "nmfe6", 
           appendModel=TRUE)

The command executed on the shell will be "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table"

The function do not need a model file, it will only execute the string commandToExecute

runNonmem(changeSeed = FALSE, 
          i = 1, 
          deleteFiles = TRUE, 
          fileToDelete = c("PRDERR","nonmem.exe","LINK", "ifort.txt","fsubs.obj","fsubs.for", 
                          "FSUBS","FSTREAM","FREPORT", "FDATA","FCON","table"), 
          commandToExecute = "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table", 
          appendModel=FALSE)

The command executed on the shell will be "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table"

The function will only execute the string commandToExecute, but will take the model file from the string nonmemModel
in order to change the seed within this file. In this way, the output file (table) can be specified 
directly in the commandToExecute option

runNonmem(nonmemModel = "modelSim.mod", 
          changeSeed = TRUE, 
           i = 1, 
           deleteFiles = TRUE, 
           fileToDelete = c("PRDERR","nonmem.exe","LINK", "ifort.txt","fsubs.obj","fsubs.for", 
                            "FSUBS","FSTREAM","FREPORT", "FDATA","FCON","table"), 
           commandToExecute = "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table", 
           appendModel=FALSE)

The command executed on the shell will be "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table"


EXAMPLE of WRONG CODE

runNonmem(nonmemModel = "modelSim.mod", 
          changeSeed = TRUE, 
          i = 1, 
          deleteFiles = TRUE, 
          fileToDelete = c("PRDERR","nonmem.exe","LINK", "ifort.txt","fsubs.obj","fsubs.for", 
                            "FSUBS","FSTREAM","FREPORT", "FDATA","FCON","table"), 
          commandToExecute = "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table", 
          appendModel=TRUE)

The command executed on the shell will be "nmfe6 modelSim.mod table modelSim.mod"

The model name is already present in the command to execute and it will also appended since appendModel is TRUE
